career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a CloudOps Engineer with a background in Java development.
      I knew since primary school that I wanted to work with computers and develop apps for them.
      During my university years, I was sure that I was going to be a developer who wouldn't have to touch anything
      related to operations.
      
      Initially, I worked with Spring and Spring Boot, developing Vaadin applications using Ebean and JPA.
      However, over the years, my interest shifted towards running applications in high-availability (HA)
      environments and adopting a cloud-native approach.
      
      I am driven by the desire to create meaningful applications and products.
      My guiding principle has always been: "I want to work on something I can show off to my mum."
      
      Today, I manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, overseeing nation-wide real-time public transport and
      passenger information applications.

education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: BSc Computer Engineering (did not finish)
        university: Budapest University of Technology and Economics
        time: 2012 - 2017
        details: |
          I attended Budapest University of Technology and Economics, pursuing a BSc in Computer Engineering.
          Although I completed 85% of my credits, I was unable to finish my degree. Due to financial constraints,
          I began working to support myself and couldn't find the time to complete my studies while working.

    title: Experiences
    info:
      - role: Senior CloudOps Enginner
        time: 2019 - Present
        company: realCity ITS, Hungary
        details: |
          At realCity, I am actively involved in managing cloud environments and implementing an infrastructure-as-code
          approach to ensure robustness and reliability of our applications. realCity specializes in building modular,
          cloud-based traffic management and passenger information systems, offering both end-to-end solutions and
          customizable options tailored to specific IT infrastructure needs for passengers, dispatchers, and drivers.

          We leverage the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model to deliver a modern, accessible experience to operators
          and organizers without upfront investments. My key responsibilities include overseeing the seamless operation
          of our applications, ensuring they perform reliably under varying conditions.

          Some of my notable achievements include:
           - Orchestrating the migration from on-premises infrastructure to an Azure-based cloud-native Kubernetes
          environment with zero downtime.
           - Customizing and managing a Keycloak-based single sign-on (SSO) system with over 2 million registered users.
           - Optimizing our deployment processes using modern infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD solutions, significantly
             accelerating our ability to deploy our technology stack and new features to new customers.     
             When I joined realCity, deploying our stack to a new customer took multiple weeks; we achieved to speed up this process, and currently, we can deploy our stack within days.
      - role: Software Engineer
        time: 2015 - 2018
        company: WebValto, Hungary
        details: |
          At WebValto, a company specializing in software engineering services and consultancy, I gained extensive
          experience developing applications primarily with Java, focusing on frameworks like Vaadin and occasionally
          using JSF and Java EE. Around 2017, during a project at WebValto, I was introduced to cloud operations and
          Docker for the first time, which sparked my keen interest in cloud-native solutions. 
          
          Despite consistently delivering exceptional applications on each project, I often encountered challenges
          with operational teams. Restricted access to production environments and difficulty in replicating issues due
          to the lack of reproducible minimal examples from the ops team were recurring frustrations. These challenges
          underscored a critical issue in IT.
  
          My exposure to managing our own code in cloud-native environments motivated me to further explore and specialize in cloud-native technologies.
      - role: Fast Food restaurant worker
        time: 2011 - 2014
        company: McDonald's
        details: |
          During late high school and early university, I worked at McDonald's. I started with frying fries and
          making cheeseburgers, but finished as a floor manager, organizing multiple people working in a shift. While
          the job was unrelated to IT, it taught me valuable skills in people management and teamwork. Managing team
          members during shifts significantly enhanced my interpersonal skills and ability to work under pressure.

        tagline: |
          OpenBudget was created with a personal goal in mind: to offer a customizable and open source budgeting
          solution that extends the features of popular budgeting apps. The inspiration for its creation came from my
          own experience using a popular budgeting app that saw a significant price increase after years of usage.
          
          I wanted to keep my budgeting data and history, but no alternative was able to fully parse their export.
          Additionally, I wanted to add features that were missing from popular budgeting apps, such as multi-currency
          support and enhanced reports.

    title: OSS Contributions
    intro: |
      When I encounter issues with the tools and applications we use, I thrive on delving into the root causes and
      finding solutions. Contributing these fixes and improvements back to the community is not just a habit but a
      passion.
      
      I have a track record of making multiple bug fixes and implementing new features in popular Java-based
      applications and libraries. Moreover, I am adept at identifying and resolving issues in libraries and
      applications written in diverse technologies like Go, Ruby, TypeScript, and more.
      
      My commitment to open-source extends beyond my primary expertise, driven by a desire to contribute
      wherever I can make an impact.

      - title: Keycloak
        link: "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues?q=author%3Avilmosnagy"
        tagline: |
          During my time managing a Keycloak instance with over 2 million users, I regularly faced challenges arising
          from concise and generalized bug reports. Understanding the significance of clarity in bug reporting, I
          dedicated myself to diligently reproducing these issues and subsequently reporting them to the upstream
          Keycloak project.
          
          Moreover, I actively contributed fixes by submitting pull requests for the majority of these issues. This
          hands-on experience not only deepened my understanding of Keycloak but also reinforced my commitment to
          improving its functionality and reliability for all users.
